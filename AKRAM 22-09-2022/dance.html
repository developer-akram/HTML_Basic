        <p>Performed on the celestial tunes of the Carnatic music, Bharatnatyam comes from the state of Tamil Nadu in
            South. The origins of Bharatnatyam can be traced back to 1000 BC, and it originates from the ancient temples
            of Tamil Nadu performed by the women of the classical period. The dance form is known for its beautiful body
            movements and gestures which are called Mudras in the traditional language. It focuses on the hand gestures,
            leg movement and the facial expressions of the dancer. This dance form was very prevalent before the British
            era but was profoundly depressed during the colonial period. However, India kept the dance form alive in the
            houses, and today it is recognised as one of the most respectable art forms in India especially in the
            Southern region of the country where it is a moment of pride for the women of the house to learn the
            classical dance form of Bharatnatyam.</p>

        <p>
            Coming from the northern part of the country from the state of Uttar Pradesh, Kathak comes from the word
            'Katha' which means "story" in Hindi. It isn't a very smart guess for one to make that Kathak is performed
            in the form of storytelling through the body movements used by the dancer. Kathak is often referred to as
            the dance of love, and it can be performed by both by the male and female dancer together. This dance form
            focuses highly on the ankle movements complemented by the ankle that has to match the beats of the music.
            Ankle bells or gunghroos as they are called in the traditional language is an important part of the
            discipline of this dance form. Various distinctions can be witnessed in this dance forms as it is performed
            in various places in the country which includes Jaipur, Benaras, and Lucknow.

            Kathakali is another traditional dance form of India which relates to the storytelling. Kathakali translates
            to the 'storyteller' in the country's language. Coming from the Southern region of the country from Kerala,
            Kathakali is one of the most renowned and religious dances forms of India. It originates from the tales of
            Ramayana and Shiva stories. Kathakali includes the intriguing face movements and the heavy costumes which
            include the traditional face masks and body paints (generally green). The music which includes only the
            vocals is called Soppanam. The storytelling of the epic Hindu mythology tales depicting both evil and good
            is shown through the conversation between the dancers only through their body gestures and facial
            expressions. Simply fascinating to watch!

            includes certain rituals such as sprinkling the holy water, burning the incense sticks and praying to God.
            Kuchipudi includes both singing and dancing by the performer which is why it requires both the skill and
            much more dedication than any other art forms in India. In the earlier period, Kuchipudi was only performed
            by the male dancers in the temples, specifically the Brahmins( Upper caste of the society) but with the
            passage of time, it became famous amongst the women and nowadays it is mostly performed by the female

        <p>
            In Indian mythology, Mohini is the female avatar of Lord Vishnu, and the meaning of Attam in Malayalam is
            rhythmic motion hence adhering to the dance of the divine enchantress. It is the second most popular dance
            form of Kerala. This classical Indian dance form roots from the age-old Sanskrit text - Natya Shastra. It is
            traditionally performed by women following a repertoire of Carnatic music, singing and acting a play. At
            times, the song, a typical hybrid of Malayalam and Sanskrit also called Manipravalam, is sung by the
            performer herself. With a repertoire of instruments such a Mridangam, Madhalam, Flute, Idakka, Veena and
            Kuzhitalam; the music is rendered in ragas and performed in a slow melodic style. Although the Lasya dance
            is often portrayed as gentle, graceful and feminine, it also exhibits a vigorous dance of Tandava relating
            to Lord Shiva. Besides its popularity, the dance was ridiculed by a series of laws as a devadasi
            prostitution system during the colonial British Raj. A ban that was protested repealed in 1940 and with the
            help of the locals of Kerala, Mohiniyattam was revived and reconstructed.

            Mahapurusha Sankaradeva, a Vaishnava saint and reformer of Assam, introduced Sattriya dance in the 15th
            century AD. This dance form was preserved in the Sattras or the Vaishnava Maths; therefore, it remained a
            living tradition. This dance was an artistic way of presenting mythological teachings. Traditionally this
            dance was performed by the male monks or bhokots. However, today, the practice has changed in many ways. The
            theme is not just related to mythology, and the performances are not limited to the Sattras. Even women can
            perform Sattriya dance and on the stage.

            Indian dances can be traced back to ancient times. In the cave paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters in
            Madhya Pradesh, one can see dancing figures. The sculptures that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization
            also portray dancing figures. The text related to the origin of dance in India can be found in Natya
            Shastra, which was written by the sage Bharata. This text dates back to the 2nd century AD. In this text,
            the creation of dance is credited to Lord Brahma, who takes its knowledge from the four Vedas.
